### Feature of this project
Search username on github and display their public repository with infinite scroll
### Goal to learn with this project
- Implement infinite scroll feature without any infinite-scroll library
- I use IntersectionObserver which is supported by modern browser to help build my infinite-scroll feature
- Learn to find the thing I need from a huge documentation 

### Some bugs
Sometimes the infinite-scroll won't work, sometimes IntersectionObserver doesn't work in Chrome
but works well in Safari.

### Todo
- Add test
